# Build a Weather App with Real-Time Data

Objective: Create a simple weather application that fetches and displays real-time weather data.

 + Requirements:

    1. Use an external API (e.g., OpenWeather API) to fetch the current weather data for a given city.
    2. Display the temperature, weather conditions (e.g., clear, cloudy), and an icon for the weather.
    3. Allow the user to input a city name and fetch the weather data for that city.

 + Technical Concepts:

    1. React state and side effects with useEffect.
    2. API integration with fetch or axios.
    3. Form handling for user input.

 + Bonus:

    1. Show a weather forecast for the next 5 days.
    2. Implement error handling for invalid city names.
