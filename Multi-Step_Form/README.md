# Build a Multi-Step Form

Objective: Create a multi-step form with React where users fill out information across multiple steps.

 + Requirements:

    1. Implement a multi-step form with at least 3 steps (e.g., personal info, address, review & submit).
    2. Users should be able to navigate between the steps.
    3. On form submission, display a summary of the user's input.

 + Technical Concepts:

    1. Component state management (use useState or useReducer).
    2. Form validation and handling.
    3. Conditional rendering based on the current step.

 + Bonus:

   1. Implement form validation for each step.
   2. Persist the form data in localStorage so it is not lost on page reload.
