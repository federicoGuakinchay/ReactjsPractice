# Build a To-Do List Application

Objective: Create a simple to-do list app where users can add, update, and delete tasks.

 + Requirements:

    1. Users should be able to:
    2. Add a task.
    3. Mark a task as complete or incomplete.
    4. Delete a task.
    5. Display the number of completed tasks out of the total tasks.
    6. Tasks should be stored in localStorage so they persist after a page reload.

 + Technical Concepts:

    1. React state and props.
    2. React component lifecycle.
    3. Use useEffect for localStorage persistence.

 + Bonus:

    1. Implement a filter to show only completed, incomplete, or all tasks.
    2. Add basic styling with CSS or a CSS-in-JS library.
    


Use  React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
