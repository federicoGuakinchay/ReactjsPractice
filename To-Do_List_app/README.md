# Build a To-Do List Application

Objective: Create a simple to-do list app where users can add, update, and delete tasks.

 + Requirements:

    1. Users should be able to:
    2. Add a task.
    3. Mark a task as complete or incomplete.
    4. Delete a task.
    5. Display the number of completed tasks out of the total tasks.
    6. Tasks should be stored in localStorage so they persist after a page reload.

 + Technical Concepts:

    1. React state and props.
    2. React component lifecycle.
    3. Use useEffect for localStorage persistence.

 + Bonus:

    1. Implement a filter to show only completed, incomplete, or all tasks.
    2. Add basic styling with CSS or a CSS-in-JS library.
