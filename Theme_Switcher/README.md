# Implement a Theme Switcher (Dark/Light Mode)

Objective: Create a theme switcher that allows the user to toggle between dark and light mode.

 + Requirements:

    1. A button to toggle between dark and light themes.
    2. Store the user's theme preference in localStorage so it persists after a page reload.
    3. Apply different CSS styles for dark and light themes (e.g., background color, text color).

 + Technical Concepts:

    1. CSS-in-JS or regular CSS for theming.
    2. React useEffect for localStorage persistence.
    3. State management with useState.

 + Bonus:

    1. Automatically detect the user's system theme preference (using window.matchMedia).
    2. Implement smooth transitions between themes using CSS transitions.
