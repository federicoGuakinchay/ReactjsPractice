# Create a Simple User Authentication Flow

Objective: Build a simple login and signup flow using React.

 + Requirements:

    1. Create two routes: /login and /signup.
    2. A user can sign up with a username and password.
    3. A user can log in and be redirected to a dashboard page (/dashboard).
    4. Display a logout button in the dashboard.
    5. Protect the dashboard route so that only authenticated users can access it.

 + Technical Concepts:

    1. React Router for routing.
    2. State management (either React's built-in state or context).
    3. Basic form handling.

 + Bonus:

    1. Implement form validation.
    2. Store authentication tokens in localStorage (for simplicity).
