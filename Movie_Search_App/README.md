# Build a Movie Search Application

Objective: Create a movie search application where users can search for movies and display the results.

 + Requirements:

    1. Use an external API (e.g., OMDB API) to fetch movie data.
    2. Implement a search bar where users can type a movie name.
    3. Display a list of matching movies with details (e.g., title, poster, release year).

 + Technical Concepts:

    1. React state and event handling.
    2. API integration.
    3. List rendering with conditional logic.

 + Bonus:

    1. Implement infinite scrolling to load more results as the user scrolls down.
    2. Add sorting options (e.g., by release date or rating).
